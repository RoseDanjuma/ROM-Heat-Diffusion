# ROM-Heat-Diffusion
# Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) for Heat Diffusion
This project demonstrates how to reduce a 2D heat diffusion PDE into a simpler model using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD).
- Full PDE solved with Finite Difference Method
- Reduced model built with SVD (keeping only 5 dominant modes)
- Comparison of full vs reduced simulation
